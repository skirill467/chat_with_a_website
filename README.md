# About

Chat With a Website using LLM is a repository designed to facilitate seamless interactions with websites through Large Language Models (LLMs). This project demonstrates how to leverage LLMs, like GPT-4, to create a conversational interface that can interact with web pages, extract information, and perform tasks based on user queries.

Key Features:
Website Interaction: Enable users to engage with any website as if they were having a natural conversation.
Data Extraction: Automatically retrieve and summarize content from websites.
Task Automation: Perform complex tasks, such as filling out forms or navigating through pages, guided by user commands.
Customizable Workflows: Easily tailor the LLMâ€™s behavior to specific websites or tasks with minimal configuration.
This repository is ideal for developers looking to integrate AI-driven chatbots into web-based applications, enhance user experience, or automate web interactions using state-of-the-art language models.
